# Data Preprocessing Demo
## Overview
Jupyter notebook, main.py, language_model and tokenizer script demonstrate natural language processing techniques.

### Scripts
language_model.py demonstrates next word predictions using probabilistic n-gram models (unigram, bi-gram, trigram, and quadgram).
Script builds and trains both word level and character level n-grams.

main.py demonstrates NlP techniques from tokenization, stopword removal, stemming and lemmatization.

word_sentence_distribution.py demonstrates word frequency distribution and sentence length distribution using NLP techniques.

### Tech Stack
- Python
- Juypter notebook

### Future Improvementz
- Implement more NLP techniques.
- Push to the cloud.
